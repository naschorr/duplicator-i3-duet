# Power Supply Dock and Mount Assembly

## Multiple Choice

There's three different ways to approach the power supply question.

### Default Maker Select Power Supply
This is the budget option, and will reuse the 12v supply that came with your Duplicator i3.

All STLs only need to be printed once, and can be printed out of any filament type you'd like.

### Normal Meanwell LRS-350-12 Power Supply
Having issues with the stock power supply? Upgrade it to a proper unit from Meanwell.

### Quiet Meanwell LRS-350-12 Power Supply
This is the ultimate option, which takes that same Meanwell unit and upgrades the case to house a significantly larger fan. The fan makes this thing nearly silent, and ideal if the printer sits in the same room as you do. I absolutely recommend this option.

Take a look at the separate upgrade page [here](../upgrades/quiet_meanwell_lrs_350_psu/quiet_meanwell_lrs_350_psu.md) that goes into greater detail.

## Bill of Materials
Note that several of the links are to parts assortments, and a single assortment should cover all of the parts of that type. Obviously, you can also source parts elsewhere if desired, the linked ones are just a convenient option.
