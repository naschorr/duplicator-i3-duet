| Duet 3 Mini 5+ Wifi                   | 1         | [Filastruder](https://www.filastruder.com/collections/electronics/products/duet-3-mini-5)                                     | My STLs don't allow for the ethernet cable to pass through them anywhere, so you must get the Wifi version.         |
| Noctua NF-A9x14 PWM                   | 1         | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQM7V2/)                                                                       | Alternatively, any 92x14mm fan will work here, I just like the performance and quietness of the Noctua. |
| 92mm Fan Filter Mesh                  | 1         | [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/ThreeBulls-Cooler-Filter-Dustproof-Computer/dp/B01N952K7P)                                  | These are 120mm, but they're easier to find, useful elsewhere, and easy to cut to shape.
| M3 6mm Socket Cap Machine Screws      | Many      | Amazon                                                                                                                        | If you've done the Z brace upgrade, then you likely have enough screws left over from that.
| M3 10mm Socket Cap Machine Screws     | Many      | Amazon
| M3 Washers                            | Many      | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CG9J4NC)                                                                        |
| M3 Hex Nuts                           | Many      | Amazon                                                                                                                        |
