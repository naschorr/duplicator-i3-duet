## Core Bill of Materials
Note that several of the links are to parts assortments, and a single assortment should cover all of the parts of that type. Obviously, you can also source parts elsewhere if desired, the linked ones are just a convenient option.

| ---- | -------- | ---- | ----- |
| Duet 3 Mini 5+ Wifi | 1 | [Filastruder](https://www.filastruder.com/collections/electronics/products/duet-3-mini-5) | My STLs don't allow for the ethernet cable to pass through them anywhere, so you must get the Wifi version.

| Noctua NF-A9x14 PWM | 1 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQM7V2/) | Alternatively, any 92x14mm fan will work here, I just like the performance and quietness of the Noctua. |
| Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX | 1 | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009NQLT0M/) | Alternatively, any 40x10mm fan will work here, I just like the performance and quietness of the Noctua. |
